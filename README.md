# C_programming_project
This is my assignment for computer organisation and programming core unit in Semester 1 2023.
In particular, stats.c, transformations.c, database.c, and search.c files are written by me and not provided by the teaching team.

The assignment revolves around mapping a set of transformed (rotated/flipped etc.) images to a set of known, untransformed images.
For a complete description of the assignment, kindly refer to the assignment brief.

This assignment tests my understanding on pointers, memory allocation, and binary search tree data structure.
A simple understanding of time complexity is also tested and demonstated via the report.txt file.
